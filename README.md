#Vocabulary Quizzer: Finnish/English

## Introduction

This project was inspired by my desire to attend WorldCon 75.  This will take place in Helsinki, Finland, in August of 2017.  I would like to have at least a minimal vocabulary for simple navigation, so I designed this application to help practice my vocabulary.

## Features

Vocabulary terms will be stored in a simple database.  Initially it will consist of a single table holding a Finnish word and its English translation.  I'm going to ignore the possibility of homophones in Finnish, on the assumption that these are unlikely in beginner vocabulary.

I might eventually add a phrase dictionary to quiz myself on tourist phrases.

## Side Notes

Finnish is syntactically very different from English.  It features heavily suffixing agglutinative morphology and numerous case endings.  Prosody is also markedly different; almost all words have stress on the first syllable, and questions are identified lexically rather than through intonation.

This course does not cover grammar, prosody, or phonology.  It assumes you already know how to read and pronounce Finnish words, and you're on your own for figuring out how to construct syntactially valid statements.
